## Comments 🎙
In order to run this application is important to create a `config.env` inside `/src/config/config.env`. 
The `env` file needs to contain the next environment variables:

- PORT=5000
- RDS_HOST
- RDS_USER
- RDS_PASSWORD
- RDS_PORT
- RDS_DATABASE

This app can be run on a `development` environment using the command `npm run dev`

The app can be accessed on localhost with the url: `https://localhost:5000/`
